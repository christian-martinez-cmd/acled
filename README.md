This data science project uses the Armed Conflict Location and Events Databse to view USA conflicts since 2018.

From ACLED's About section:

The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) is a disaggregated data collection, analysis, and crisis mapping project. ACLED collects the dates, actors, locations, fatalities, and types of all reported political violence and protest events across Africa, the Middle East, Latin America & the Caribbean, East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Central Asia & the Caucasus, Europe, and the United States of America. The ACLED team conducts analysis to describe, explore, and test conflict scenarios, and makes both data and analysis open for free use by the public.

#Initial CSV

The initial CSV file used was over 300MB and could not be uploaded to Github due to size limitations. The large CSV was subsequently reduced with only the North America region instead of the rest of the other regions.
